    <h1>Avacado Toast</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> The avacado toast is an excellent breakfast option or a light evening snack. At its core, mashed salted avacado is spread over butter toasted bread.</p>
    <p> Of course, many different variations exist. Of my go to variations is to add friend eggs or sunny side up over the avacado spread. Top that off with some cheese and you are good to go.</p>
